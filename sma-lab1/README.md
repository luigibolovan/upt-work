### Lab 1
**Assignment:** 
Create a layout that contains two items - one button and one text view. Create a Kotlin data class that acts as a text holder. Initially, the text view displays "Hello World!" but once the button is pressed, it should change to whatever you've stored in the previously defined text holder.
